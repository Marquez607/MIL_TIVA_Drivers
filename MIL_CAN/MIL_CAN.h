 * Desc: A set of wrapper functions I designed
 *       to standardized CAN use in the Lab
 *       this primarily is to reduce the number
 *       of bugs caused by the CAN bus
 *
 * Notes: CAN devices should be run at 100k bps
 *        and PCBs on the network should have on
 *        board termination resistors
